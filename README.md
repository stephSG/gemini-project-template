# Gemini + Claude Compatible Project

This project is preconfigured to work with:
- Gemini CLI (interactive, Claude-like behavior)
- Claude Code (native support)

## Usage

### Start Gemini in Claude-like mode
```bash
./scripts/gemini-claude.sh
```

Gemini starts normally, but with rules injected at startup.

### Use Claude Code
Open the project in Claude Code.
Rules are read from CLAUDE.md automatically.
